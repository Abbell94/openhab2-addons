# distribution

* Test on windows machine (e.g. bin/setenv.bin for http(s) port)
* The bundle org.openhab.core.init contains the logging stuff only. This one is
  not needed for Karaf anymore. Should we remove the whole bundle or leave it
  empty.

# not supported on upstream openHAB, but should be done
* system property for keystore location (jetty)
